 To be or not to be, that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outra
geous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of trouble and by oppsoing end them. To die, to sleep, no more. And by
 a sleep to say we end the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. Tis a consumation devou
tly to be wished, to sleep, to die... Aye, there's the rub, for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we
 have shuffled of this mortal coil must give us pause. There's the respect that makes calamity of so long life. For
 who would bear the whips and scorns of time, the oppresors wrong. The proud mans contumely. The pangs of despised 
love, the laws delay. The insolence of office, and the spurns that the patient merit of the unworthy takes. For who
 would fardels bear to grunt a sweat under a weary life, but that the dread of something after death, the undiscove
red country from whose borne no traveller returns, puzzles the will and makes us rather bear those ills we have tha
n fly to others we know not of. Thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, and the natural hue of resolution is s
icklied over by the pale cast of thought. And enterprises with great pith and moment, with this reguard, their curr
ents turn awry... and lose the name of action.

 This editor
 is also going
 to need to
 be able to
 scroll down
 when text
 goes off the
 end of the
 screen. We
 Need some way
 to take care
 of scrolling
 when text
 goes too far
 down. That's
 why I'm 
 typing this
 section like
 this. It will
 help with testing.
 You should be
 able to scroll
 down and see
 this text.
